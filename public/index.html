    <meta name="Description" CONTENT="This map is focused on incidents in Ukraine collected by Bellingcat that have resulted in potential civilian harm. These include: incidents that struck civilian areas, resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure, where the presence of civilian injuries are visible, and/or the presence of immobile civilian bodies. This database began collection on February 24, 2022 and intends to be a living document that will continue to be updated as long as the conflict persists. For more detailed information about the incidents included and the information added by Bellingcat investigators, please refer to our methodology.">
